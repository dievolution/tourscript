Tour Script v1

Files:
index.html			Demo Page
css/site.css		Demo Site css

css/tour.css		Tourscript css (needed)
scripts/tour.js	Tourscript
tour.json				demo tour

scripts/jqueryui jqueryui, only for highlight effect


	Usage:
	create a .json file in the following format:
	[
		{
			"element" 	: "#divtoshow",
			"label"			: "description",
			"options" 	: "interactive",
			"highlight"	: ".inner"
		},
		{
			"element" 	: "#divtoshow",
			"label"			: "description",
			"options" 	: "interactive",
			"highlight"	: ".inner"
		},
	]

	Each hash is one item in the tour.
	- "element" is the box who should be higlighted. This can be any valid jquery selector (must be unique, or the first one will be chosen)
	- "label" is the description displayed underneath or above the highlighted element. It can contain html elements.
	- "options": Just write an option as text in this part to activate. The following options are currently available:
	- - interactive : when using this option, the user will be able to click something in the highlighted element. Any form submit or link click will continue to the next part of the tour
	- - lastItem : this option should be used for the last element of the tour. This will replace the 'continue tour' link with a 'end tour' link, closing the tour.
	- "highlight" is a highlight option for an element in the chosen element. The element will pulsate so the user can see what the description is currently talking about.
